# TOP 9 Design Patterns in Go that everybody should know!
1) Strategy Pattern
> Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary from clients that use it.

> Example: Payment processing with different payment methods.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/strategy.go)

2) Observer Pattern
> Defines a one-to-many dependancy between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

> Example: Event handling in graphical user interface.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/observer.go)

3) Singletone Pattern
> Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point to this instance.

> Example: Database connection manager in a web application.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/singleton.go)

4) Adapter Pattern
> Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

> Example: Using different power adapters for electronic devices in different countries.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/adapter.go)

5) Facade Pattern
> Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

> Example: Using a single button to start a computer, which internally performs various tasks.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/facade.go)

6) Factory Pattern
> Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the sublcasses, creating the instance of a class in its subclasses.

> Example: Creating different type of documents in a word processor.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/factory.go)

7) Abstract Factory Pattern
> Provides an interface for creating families or related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

> Example: Creating furniture sets for different styles.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/abstract_factory.go)

8) Decorator Pattern
> Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

> Example: Upgrading items & attributes in games.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/decorator.go)

9) Command Pattern
> Encapsulates a request as an objectm thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests and providing support of undoable operations.

> Example: Remote control for electronic devices.

> Code: [Go!](https://github.com/silvermete0r/problem_solving_coding_time/blob/main/AITU/2-Software-Design-Patterns-(GO)/Final%20Exam/command.go)
